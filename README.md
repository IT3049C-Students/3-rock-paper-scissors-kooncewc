## Self-Evaluation: 
Based on the Rubric I think 16/20. I received some error with my tests, but overall the logic is solid and the code is very close to fully functioning

## Team Reflection:
My biggest issue was with handling the controllers and some ofthe game logic, It was hard to check how my work was functioning before I completed the project without running the npm test.
